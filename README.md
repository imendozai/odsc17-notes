### Sessions I want to attend: 

- Keynote Address (9:30 AM in Room 302,304,306)

### Challenges and practical solutions in successful developing and delivery of data science applications (11:00 AM in Room 309) | [R-Brain](https://r-brain.io/en/)

- **Five steps in building a model for data analytics from**:
prep, model development, collaboration, validation, deployment

1. Model development:

    1. **Challenges**: different tools and languages; integration; individual preferences; Security vs. Flexibility; resource allocation
    2. **Solutions**: IDE's custom for DS; language kernels; server-based IDE's or Virtual machine (containers like Docker) but they are not built for sharing. Cloud platforms with combination with _containers_ can be a flexible option

2. Collaboration & validation:

    1. **Challenges**: Reproducibility; Communication between modelers and SME/business people (practicality vs business constraints); Hardware & Software
    2. **Solutions**: Code development best practices (Git/GutHub) - problems arise with package versions and environment dependencies. Models as _containers_.

3. Delivery / Deployment:

    1. **Challenges**: User interface and interpretation; Scaling and resources; security and access
    2. **Solutions**: Web app frameworks (shiny, bokeh); _Container technology_. cloud platform s can enable easy refinement of user access.

- **What is container technology (Docker)?**: wrap a piece of Software in a complete filesystem. Have shared HW but different containers. Don't need local host anymore!

- **Benefits of using cloud**: meet increasing storage demands, faster time-to-market, cost savings, improved disaster recovery plans.

- **Migrating to cloud using containers**: development and environment tools :arrow_forward: building and maintaining images :arrow_forward: installation of system libraries in the containers :arrow_forward: container orchestration (devOps role) :arrow_forward: deployment.


- _Precision agriculture: Predicting outcomes for farmers using machine learning to help feed the world (11:45 AM in Room 301)_
